## Project Overview

This project explores a bike-sharing dataset to understand the factors affecting bike rental demand. The main goal is to build a predictive model using Linear Regression to estimate the number of bikes rented based on various features.

## Dataset

- The dataset contains historical data of bike rentals, including features such as weather conditions, time, and user information.
- (Add a note about where the dataset is from, e.g., UCI Machine Learning Repository, Kaggle, or provided as part of the assignment.)

## Objective

- Analyze the dataset to identify key factors influencing bike rentals.
- Build and evaluate a Linear Regression model to predict bike rental counts.

## Approach

1. **Data Exploration:**  
   - Load and inspect the dataset.
   - Visualize data distributions and relationships.
2. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
   - Feature engineering if necessary.
3. **Model Building:**  
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Train a Linear Regression model.
   - Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, RÂ²).
4. **Results Interpretation:**  
   - Analyze model coefficients and feature importance.
   - Visualize predictions vs. actual values.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open `bike sharing.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and results.

## Results

- (Summarize key findings, model performance, and any insights gained from the analysis.)
